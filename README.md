# lem-in

Graph algo project. Created with nalexand at 42 school. The main task - find all optimal ways to push ants from A to B as quick as possible, they must not overlap . To find all needed paths to the ants we use algorithms Dijkstra and Ford-Falkerson

**Quick start with visualisition**

  make
  
  ./visu-hex out
  
If you want other maps:
  
  make
  
  ./lem-in maps/"any map in the folder" > out
  
  ./visu-hex out

You will see something like this (there is two optimal way)
